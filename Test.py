1. Showcase Your Dance Moves! 

Task 1: Code Correction 

weather = "sunny" 
 
if weather == "sunny": 
    print("Wear sunglasses!") 
else: 
    print("Take an umbrella!") 

 

 

Task 2: Your Mood Today 

# Ask the user how they feel today 
user_feeling = input("How are you feeling today? ") 
 
# Check the user's response 
if user_feeling.lower() == "happy": 
    print("That's great to hear!") 
elif user_feeling.lower() == "sad": 
    print("I hope your day gets better!") 
else: 
    print("I'm not sure how you're feeling, but I'm here to chat!") 

 

2. Python Naming Convention Practice 

Task 1: Code Correction 

pi_value = 3.14 
user_age = 25 
user_location = "New York" 
MAX_LIMIT = 1000 

 

 

 

 

 

3. Python Data Types and type() Function 

Task 1: Code Correction 

variable_a = "Hello, World!" 
variable_b = 23 
variable_c = 3.14 
variable_d = True 
 
print("Data type of variable_a:", type(variable_a)) 
print("Data type of variable_b:", type(variable_b)) 
print("Data type of variable_c:", type(variable_c)) 
print("Data type of variable_d:", type(variable_d)) 

 

4. Arithmetic Operations in Daily Life 

Task 1: Grocery Store Math 

# Given prices of grocery items 
price_bread = 2.00 
price_peanut_butter = 3.00 
price_jelly = 1.00 
 
# Calculate the total cost 
total_cost = price_bread + price_peanut_butter + price_jelly 
 
# Display the result 
print(f"The total cost of buying bread, peanut butter, and jelly is ${total_cost:.2f}") 

 

 

Task 2: Bank Interest 

# Given initial amount and interest rate 
initial_amount = 10000 
interest_rate = 7 
 
# Calculate the total amount after one year 
total_amount_after_one_year = initial_amount * (1 + interest_rate / 100) 
 
# Display the result 
print(f"The total amount after one year at {interest_rate}% interest rate is ${total_amount_after_one_year:.2f}") 

 

5. Understanding Assignments and Comparisons 

Task 1: Value Swapping 

# Given two numbers 
a = 10 
b = 18 
 
# Swap the values using assignment operators 
a, b = b, a 
 
# Compare the swapped values 
if a == 18 and b == 10: 
    print("Values have been successfully swapped.") 
else: 
    print("Values have not been swapped correctly.") 

 

6. Exploring Logical Operations and Precedence 

 

# Calculate the expression normally 
result_normal = 1 + 2 * 2 - 6 / 3 
print(f"Result (Normal): {result_normal}") 
 
# Calculate the expression with parentheses 
result_parentheses = (1 + (2 * 2)) - (6 / 3) 
print(f"Result (Parentheses): {result_parentheses}") 

 

Task 2: Mix and Match 

# Calculate the expression 
result = (6 + 3) > 10 or (7 + 7) == 14 
 
# Print the result 
print(f"Result: {result}")
